# linear-equation-solver

A simple Linear Equation Solver that supports complex numbers done for learning purposes. In order to use it, just create a text file called "in.txt" with the following format.
In the first line you introduce the number of variables, and the number of equations.

3 3
1+i 2+6i 7-8i 12
-7i 123 12+i i
11-11i 12+i -i 1+i

Then, the program will write the solution in an output "out.txt". Both files need to be passed through the command line
